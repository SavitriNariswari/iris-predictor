# iris-predictor
Uses the famous Iris flower data set from Kaggle and SVM model to predict the species of iris flowers based on its features.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
